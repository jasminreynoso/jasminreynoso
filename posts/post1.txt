Modern web development has evolved significantly over the years, moving from simple static HTML pages to dynamic, interactive applications. In this post, I'll guide you through the fundamentals of getting started with modern web development.

The foundation of modern web development rests on three core technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. However, the ecosystem has expanded to include frameworks, libraries, and tools that make development more efficient and scalable.

When starting your journey, it's important to understand the basics before diving into frameworks. Having a solid grasp of vanilla JavaScript will make learning frameworks like React or Vue much easier. Similarly, understanding CSS fundamentals will help you appreciate what CSS frameworks are doing under the hood.

Modern development also involves understanding version control with Git, package managers like npm, and build tools that help optimize and bundle your code. These tools are essential for working in a professional development environment.

The web development landscape is constantly changing, but the core principles remain the same. Focus on learning the fundamentals well, and you'll be able to adapt to new technologies as they emerge. Remember, every expert was once a beginner!
