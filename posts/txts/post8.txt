Git is an essential tool for version control that every developer should master. It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and maintain a history of your project.

The basic workflow involves creating a repository, making changes to files, staging those changes, and committing them with a descriptive message. This creates snapshots of your project that you can return to at any time.

Branches are one of Git's most powerful features. They allow you to work on different features or experiments without affecting your main codebase. You can create, switch between, and merge branches as needed.

Remote repositories, like those on GitHub, enable collaboration. You can push your local changes to share them with others, pull changes made by teammates, and resolve conflicts when multiple people edit the same files.

Learning Git might seem overwhelming at first, but start with the basics: add, commit, push, and pull. As you become more comfortable, explore branching, merging, and more advanced features. Git is a skill that will serve you throughout your development career.
