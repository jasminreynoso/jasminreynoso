Writing clean, maintainable JavaScript is essential for building scalable applications. Here are some key best practices to follow.

First, use meaningful variable and function names. Code should be self-documenting. Avoid abbreviations and single-letter variables except for loop counters.

Always declare variables with const or let, never var. Use const by default and only use let when you need to reassign the variable. This prevents accidental reassignments and makes your code more predictable.

Break down complex functions into smaller, single-purpose functions. Each function should do one thing well. This makes your code easier to test, debug, and maintain.

Handle errors gracefully with try-catch blocks and provide meaningful error messages. Don't let errors crash your entire application.

Finally, keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). If you find yourself writing the same code multiple times, extract it into a reusable function.
