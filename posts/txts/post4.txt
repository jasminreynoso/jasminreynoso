Responsive design ensures your website looks great and functions well on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. With the increasing variety of screen sizes, responsive design is no longer optional - it's essential.

The foundation of responsive design is flexible layouts. Use relative units like percentages, em, rem, and viewport units instead of fixed pixels. This allows elements to scale proportionally.

Media queries are your primary tool for adapting designs to different screen sizes. They let you apply different styles based on device characteristics like width, height, and orientation.

Start with a mobile-first approach. Design for the smallest screen first, then progressively enhance for larger screens. This ensures your site works well on all devices and often results in better performance.

Test your designs on real devices when possible. Emulators and browser dev tools are helpful, but nothing beats testing on actual hardware to see how users will experience your site.
