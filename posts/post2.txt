Building your first API can seem daunting, but it's actually quite straightforward once you understand the core concepts. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different applications to communicate with each other.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple REST API using Node.js and Express. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it's a set of principles for designing networked applications. REST APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations.

The first step is to set up your project. Initialize a new Node.js project and install Express, which is a minimal web framework for Node.js. Express makes it easy to create routes and handle HTTP requests.

Once you have Express set up, you can start defining routes. A route is a combination of an HTTP method and a path. For example, GET /api/users would retrieve all users, while POST /api/users would create a new user.

Error handling is crucial in API development. Make sure to handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes. Status codes like 200 (success), 201 (created), 404 (not found), and 500 (server error) help clients understand what happened with their request.

Testing your API is equally important. Tools like Postman or writing automated tests can help ensure your API works correctly. Remember, a well-designed API is intuitive, consistent, and well-documented.
