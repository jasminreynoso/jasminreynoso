CSS Grid and Flexbox are both powerful layout tools, but they serve different purposes. Understanding when to use each can significantly improve your CSS skills and make your layouts more efficient.

Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts - either in a row or a column. It's perfect for aligning items within a container, distributing space evenly, and creating responsive navigation bars. If you need to arrange items in a single direction with flexible sizing, Flexbox is your tool.

CSS Grid, on the other hand, is designed for two-dimensional layouts. It allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns simultaneously. Grid is ideal for page layouts, card grids, and any scenario where you need precise control over both horizontal and vertical placement.

A common question is: can you use both? Absolutely! In fact, they complement each other well. You might use Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for aligning items within each grid cell. This combination gives you maximum flexibility.

Here's a quick rule of thumb: use Flexbox for components (like a navigation bar or a card's internal layout) and Grid for layout (like the overall page structure). But remember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer - sometimes either tool could work, and your choice might come down to what feels more intuitive for your specific use case.

Both Grid and Flexbox have excellent browser support now, so don't hesitate to use them in your projects. Start simple, experiment, and you'll develop an intuition for when to use which tool.
